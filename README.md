# HR-Analytics---Predict-Employee-Attrition

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes employee data to uncover the key factors driving attrition and predict which employees are most at risk of leaving a multinational consultancy firm. Leveraging machine learning and data visualization tools, it supports proactive HR strategies for talent retention.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify significant causes of employee attrition.
- Build predictive models to detect at-risk employees.
- Recommend actionable steps to reduce turnover.
- Visualize trends through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data analysis and machine learning (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- **SHAP**: Model interpretability
- **Power BI**: Dashboard development
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment

---

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Scaled numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed attrition by departments, income, overtime, travel, and tenure

3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models
   - Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve

4. **SHAP Analysis**
   - Interpreted feature importance using SHAP values
   - Identified top features: Monthly Income, Overtime, Age, Years at Company

5. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Visualized high-risk employee segments
   - Real-time flags for attrition prediction
   - Interactive filters and visual insights

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Younger, single employees with low income and frequent overtime are at high attrition risk.
- Sales and HR departments have higher turnover.
- Employees living closer to work are less likely to leave.
- Attrition is most frequent within the first 2 years.
